# Amaffiliate

Amaffiliate is a custom Wordpress plugin I developed for Amazon Affiliates when I found that Amazon US and Amazon UK used different ASIN codes for some products.  The current offering of Amazon Affiliate plugins will only let you add one ASIN per product, so I made Amaffiliate to get around this problem.

Amaffiliate is still in development, and as such certain functions do not exist, and the code is quite raw.  It does however work well.  

### Version
0.5.1

### Installation

Download Amaffiliate zip from GitHub and upload to your Wordpress installation.  Setup information and configuration can be found within the Settings -> General option in your Wordpress Dashboard.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

I can't do it all on my own, and I am still learning, so please feel free to fork this repository and contribute.
