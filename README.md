# Amaffiliate

Amaffiliate is a custom Wordpress plugin I developed for Amazon Affiliates when I found that Amazon US and Amazon UK used different ASIN codes for some products.  The current offering of Amazon Affiliate plugins will only let you add one ASIN per product, so I made Amaffiliate to get around this problem.

Amaffiliate is still in development, and as such certain functions do not exist, and the code is quite raw.  It does however work well.  

### Version
0.5

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh
